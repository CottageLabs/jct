This release introduced a funder configuration and funder language pack that can be used to tailor the JCT 
frontend to the needs of individual funders.  At this point, there is only one configuration and one language pack 
in use by all the funders.  With this release, we introduce the possibility down-the-line to change this so that 
results from JCT are custom to the selected funder.
