The release changes how the Self-Archiving route is calculated.  The check for whether the journal has been listed
in the cOAlition S datasource of journals known to permit Self-Archiving, irrespective of their publicly stated
policy has been moved to occur before any check to OA.Works.  This has a number of impacts:

* Self-Archiving route checks are now faster for journals which have indicated to cOAlition S that they will allow
  Self-Archiving, as no call to the external OA.Works API is required
* Journals on the cOAlition S list previously only appeared as Plan S compliant if the selected funder supported 
  Rights Retention.  This change modifies that so that any journal which has indicated they support Self-Archiving 
  will appear as compliant, irrespective of the Rights Retention policy of the funder.
