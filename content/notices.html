<p><strong>How does Journal Checker Tool use this information?</strong></p>
<p>cOAlition S and Cottage Labs LLP uses all personal information for the purpose that you have provided it for. Information submitted via the feedback function will be used for no other purpose than to respond to your query.</p>
<p><strong>Does cOAlition S share my personal information with anyone?</strong></p>
<p>We use <strong>Cottage Labs LLP</strong> as data processor. <strong>Cottage Labs LLP</strong> and their sub-processors are third parties who provide elements of services for us. They are based in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>We have contracts in place with our data processors. This means that they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will not share your personal information with any organisation apart from us. They will hold it securely and retain it for the period we instruct.</p>
<p>cOAlition S may share some of your personal information with other parties if it is necessary to provide you with a service that you have requested, or if it is required by law to do so. This may include sharing information with parties that are located outside of the EEA.</p>
<p>cOAlition S will only share the information that is necessary to provide you with the requested service, and only if it has the necessary guarantees that the recipients comply with privacy regulations that offer you the same level of protection as the General Data Protection Regulation does within the EU.</p>
<p><strong>Does cOAlition S protect my information?</strong></p>
<p>cOAlition S and Cottage Labs LLP make every effort to ensure that its servers and data storage, as well as those of third parties that we share your information with, are secured, and that your personal information is not disclosed, destroyed, lost, used, accessed, or modified without authorisation.</p>
<p><strong>For how long does cOAlition S keep my information?</strong></p>
<p>We will store your personal information for 1 year, unless a longer period of retention is required to comply with legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, cOAlition S will take into account the amount, type, and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of that information, whether it can achieve the purpose without that information, and any legal requirements.</p>
