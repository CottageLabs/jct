# JCT Public API

The api is available at [{{< param apidocs.ApiURL >}}]({{< param apidocs.ApiURL >}}).

## Request a compliance calculation

To carry out a compliance calculation, you can make a get request, as detailed below.

```
GET /calculate?issn=[issn]&funder=[funder]&ror=[ror]
```

The server will execute the algorithm, and gather responses for all routes 
before responding to the request.

The parameters you can pass to the `/calculate` endpoint are as follows:

* **issn** - either the print or online ISSN of the journal you wish to check. *required*
* **funder** - the JCT ID for the funder that you wish to check.  Allowable Funder IDs are listed [here](/funder-ids). *optional*
* **ror** - the ROR ID of the organisation that you wish to check.  See [https://ror.org](https://ror.org/) for more information. *optional*

The `issn` field is the only *required* field, though without the `ror` and `funder` fields your results will
be partial, and may not give you complete and accurate information.  

If you enter an invalid `funder`, the API will respond with a `400 (Bad Request)`

The `ror` field is optional, and is equivalent to selecting "Not affiliated" via the User Interface.

### Overall response format

```json
{
  "request" : {
    "started" : "<(int) start timestamp of the request>",
    "ended" : "<(int) end timestamp of the request>",
    "took" : "<(int) the time in ms between request start and end (on the server, not including travel time)>",
    "journal" : [
      {
        "id": "<journal issn>", 
        "title": "<journal title>", 
        "issn" : ["<all of the matching issn's for this journal>"],
        "publisher" : "<journal publisher>"
      }
    ],
    "funder" : [
      {"id": "<funder ID>", "title": "<funder title>"}
    ],
    "institution" : [
      {"id": "<institution ROR>", "title": "<institution title>"}
    ],
    "checks": ["<list of routes calculated, (see Route IDs below)>"]
  },
  "compliant" : "<(bool) true|false if there is at least one compliant card in the list of cards to show the user>",
  "results" : [
    {"<route response objects as per the below>": ""}
  ],
  "cards" : [
    {"<cards to be displayed as per the below>" :  ""}
  ]
}
```

### Per-Route response data

For each route, there is a general response format:

```json
{
  "route" : "<the id of the route (see Route IDs below)>",
  "compliant" : "<the Compliance ID for this route result (see below)",
  "qualifications" : [
    {"<qualification id> (see below)" : { "<qualification specific data (if needed)>" : "" }}
  ],
  "issn" : ["<the issn checked for this result, if there is one>"],
  "funder" : "<the funder checked on this result, if there is one>",
  "ror" : "the ror relevant to this result, if there is one>",
  "log" : [
    {
      "code" : "<algorithm transition code (see below)>",
      "parameters" : {
        "<parameter name>" : ["<parameter value>"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Route IDs

* `fully_oa` - Fully OA route
* `self_archiving` - Self Archiving route
* `ta` - Transformative Agreement route
* `tj` - Transformative Journal route
* `hybrid` - Hybrid Journal route

#### Compliance IDs

* `yes` - Route offers compliance
* `no` - Route does not offer compliance
* `unknown` - Not known if route offers compliance

#### Qualification IDs

* `doaj_under_review` - the journal is in the DOAJ "in progress" or "under review" list, not the public DOAJ
    * no qualification specific data required
* `rights_retention_author_advice` - the journal does not have an SA policy and does not appear in the rights retention data source
    * no qualification specific data required
* `corresponding_authors` - the TA is only open to corresponding authors
    * no qualification specific data required
  
#### Log

The log provides a list of decision transitions through the algorithm, in order of traversal.  This allows you to 
see the path through the algorithm that was taken to reach the decision, along with any relevant parameters.

See the table below for a full list of transitions, their meanings, and the parameters that may be associated.

For example, items such as this may be present:

```json
{
  "log" : [
    { "code" : "FullOA.InDOAJ" },
    { 
      "code" : "FullOA.Compliant",
      "parameters" : {
        "licence" : ["CC BY", "CC-BY-SA"]
      }
    } 
  ]
}
```

### Cards to show the user

The list of cards in the `cards` section of the response defines what single routes to compliance
the funder wants the user to be made aware of.  Cards are shown based on the compliance routes
in the `results` section of the API response, and only cards which should be show to the user will
be listed.  The content of the `cards` section of the response
contains the full definitions of each card, which you can display to the user using the langage
files provided for that funder (see below).

```json
{
  "id": "[card_id]",
  "match_routes": {
    "must": [
      "[route_id]"
    ],
    "or": [
      "[route_id]",
      "[route_id]"
    ],
    "not": [
      "[route_id]"
    ]
  },
  "match_qualifications": {
    "must": [
      "[route_id].[qualification_id]"
    ],
    "or": [
      "[route_id].[qualification_id]",
      "[route_id].[qualification_id]"
    ],
    "not": [
      "[route_id].[qualification_id]"
    ]
  },
  "preferred": "true|false",
  "compliant": "true|false",
  "display_if_compliant": [
    "[route_id]",
    "[route_id]"
  ],
  "modal": "[modal_id]"
}
```

* `cards[].id` - a unique id for the card, an arbitrary string, but which will be used to identify the
  card throughout the language files
* `cards[].match_routes` - match rules for compliant routes to determine if to show this card
  * `must` - all routes listed must be compliant
  * `or` - at least one of the routes listed must be compliant
  * `not` - none of the routes listed may be compliant
* `cards[].match_qualifications` - match rules for qualifications present in calculated routes
  * `must` - all qualifications listed must be present
  * `or` - at least one of the qualifications listed must be present
  * `not` - none of the qualifications listed may be present
* `cards[].preferred` - the card represents a preferred route to compliance by the funder
* `cards[].compliant` - the card represents a route to compliance, and the presence of at least one in the results will trigger
  the compliant style in the front end.
* `cards[].display_if_compliant` - the list of routes, in order, to display information about if they are compliant.  If you leave
  this blank then no route-specific guidance will be displayed, but the `default` text for the card will be displayed anyway, so
  you only need to use this option if the card could display information about multiple routes, and you wish to control which
  information is displayed depending on which routes are compliant
* `cards[].modal` - the modal to bind to the card's overall modal (other modals can be specified inline in the card text as normal)


## Funder Specific Configurations and Language

Each funder in JCT may specify custom language for how the compliance information should be
interpreted and displayed to end users.  This information is heavily geared towards use in the JCT user interface.
Nonetheless it is available also via the API for use by any downstream systems, should they wish.  

```
GET /lang/<funder id>
```

The response is a JSON document which contains all of the language used by the JCT front end, which covers
* General site text specific to the funder
* Text for all API log codes
* Content for all compliance cards
* Any modals attached to any part of the information

## Transformative Journals

Determine if a journal is a transformative journal, using the issn:

```
GET /tj/{issn}
```

Response format:

```json
{
  "issn" : "<issn requested>",
  "transformative_journal" : true
}
```

OR `404` if record not found

## Transformative Agreements

```
GET /ta?issn={issn}&ror={ror}
```

Response format:

```json
{
  "started" : "<start timestamp of the request>",
  "ended" : "<end timestamp of the request>",
  "took" : "<the time in ms between request start and end (on the server, not including travel time)>",
  "route" : "<ta> # indicating a check for transformative agreement was done in the api",
  "compliant" : "<true/false> # (if there is an agreement, this is true. Otherwise false.)",
  "qualifications" : [
    {
      "<qualification id> (see below)" : { "<qualification specific data (if needed)>" : "" }
    }
  ],
  "issn" : "<issn in the TA>",
  "ror" : "<ror in the TA>",
  "log" : [
    {
      "action" : "<description of the action (see above for details.)>",
      "result" : "<the outcome of the action (optional, depending on circumstance)>"
    }
   ]
}
```

OR `404` if no TA exists for that combination.
