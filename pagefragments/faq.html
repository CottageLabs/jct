<h1>Q: What is Plan S / cOAlition S?</h1>
<p>cOAlition S is an initiative to make full and 
immediate Open Access to research publications a reality. 
It is built around Plan S, which consists of one target 
and <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/addendum-to-the-coalition-s-guidance-on-the-implementation-of-plan-s/principles-and-implementation/">10 principles</a>.
cOAlition S funders (a group of national research funders, European and 
international organisations and charitable foundations) have agreed to 
implement the 10 principles of Plan S in a coordinated way, together with 
the European Commission (<a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/why-plan-s/">More details</a>).</p>
<h1>Q: What is the Journal Checker Tool for?</h1>
<p>The Journal Checker Tool is provided by cOAlition S to authors to support them in finding Plan S compliant "routes" through which to publish their articles. The tool allows an author to enter the name of a funder, an institution and the journal to which they plan to submit an article, and checks if this combination of funder, institution and journal offers any route to compliance with Plan S.</p>
<h1>Q: Do I need to use the Journal Checker Tool?</h1>
<p>You are certainly not required to use the Journal Checker Tool. However, it may be useful for you to check if you are able to publish in a particle journal according to the policy set by your funder, if that funder is part of cOAlition S (the Journal Checker Tool will check if your funder is included).</p>
<h1>Q: My funder is not listed - what should I do?</h1>
<p>If your funder is not listed in the Journal Checker Tool, then this means that the funder is 
not a member of cOAlition S and, in this case, the Plan S compliance rules do not apply.</p>
<h1>Q: My institution is not listed - what should I do?</h1>
<p>If you cannot find your institution in the list of known institutions, you can 
select the checkbox labelled "Not part of HE" to perform a compliance check without 
taking into account your institution.</p>
<p>You may be able to locate your institution under one of its name variants, 
so you could try looking it up by its full name, abbreviated name or any other variations 
that you are aware of.</p>
<p>The lookup will also accept a <a href="https://ror.org/">ROR ID</a>.  If you are able to locate 
your institution in the ROR database, you can enter the ROR ID directly.</p>
<p>If you think your institution should be listed, then please also get in touch via the 
feedback link in the Journal Checker Tool and let us know about the issue.</p>
<h1>Q: The journal to which I want to submit my article is not listed - what should I do?</h1>
<p>If you cannot quickly locate the journal you want to submit to by name, you can enter the ISSN of the journal instead, which may make it easier to find.</p>
<p>If you still can't find the journal you wish to publish in, then it may not be in our journals list, so please get in touch via the feedback link and let us know.</p>
<h1>Q: What is a Transformative Journal?</h1>
<p>A Transformative Journal is a subscription/hybrid journal that is committed to transitioning to a fully OA journal. In addition, it must:</p>
<ul>
<li>gradually increase the share of OA content and</li>
<li>offset subscription income from payments for publishing services (to avoid double payments).</li>
</ul>

<h1>Q: What is a Transformative Agreement?</h1>
<p>Plan S supports the global <a href="https://oa2020.org/">Open Access 2020 Initiative (OA2020)</a> which 
aims to accelerate the transition to Open Access by adopting strategies to systematically 
withdraw financial support of paywalled publishing venues and reinvest those funds to 
support Open Access publishing. cOAlition S encourages that publishers enter into 
transformative arrangements globally in all countries and share data from such arrangements.</p>
<p>cOAlition S strongly encourages institutions and consortia to develop new transformative 
agreements and will only financially support agreements after 1 of January 2021 where they 
adhere to the <a href="https://esac-initiative.org">ESAC Guidelines</a>.</p>
