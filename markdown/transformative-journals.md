# Transformative Journals data

The JCT list of TA data can be obtained as a CSV from:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT2SPOjVU4CKhP7FHOgaf0aRsjSOt-ApwLOy44swojTDFsWlZAIZViC0gdbmxJaEWxdJSnUmNoAnoo9/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv

The format of the CSV is straightforward:

* Journal Title - The journal title according to the publisher when reporting the TJ to JCT
* ISSN (Print) - The Print ISSN of the journal, if available
* e-ISSN (Online/Web) - The Electronic ISSN of the journal, if available
